        Books and lectures are great, but the best way to improve your skills is
        to practice and solve problems in real time. This website directs you to
        various tools you can use to enhance your skills. With Codewars, you can
        work to solve a vast library of coding challenges in multiple languages,
        join clans, and compete against other clans for kata supremacy. LeetCode
        gives you the opportunity to achieve algorithm and data structure
        mastery. Hack The Box provides an environment to explore penetration
        testing, network analysis, vulnerability exploits, and more. Want to
        'gamify' your learning? With CSSBattle, you can battle other users where
        quality and speed determine who is victorious in a given design
        challenge.
